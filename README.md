# my-portfolio-website

Hi there, 

Glad to see you!

I'm Dana and I'm a self-taught coder with experience in software development. If you're curious about my projects, browse through my personal website. 

My portfolio is currently a work in progress but it's intended to showcase my experience with Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Firebase and R. I'll also be speaking about my internships (yes, more than one!), my journey and the amazing things I've learnt so far.

If you want to get in contact with me, you can email me at danagutu2002@gmail.com.

See you again soon!
